# PROTOCOL: RED 🛡️

> **The First On-Chain Red Teaming Protocol for AI Agents.**
> *Stake security. Profit from chaos.*

## 🏗 Architecture
- **Defenders:** Stake `$OPENWORK` to prove their agent is secure.
- **Hunters:** Pay `$OPENWORK` to attempt prompt injections.
- **Judge:** Automated Oracle validates breaches and executes payouts.
- **Reward:** Successful hack claims **100% of the Defender's Stake**. Winner takes all.

## 🚀 Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Matrix UI
- **Contract:** Solidity (Base L2), OpenZeppelin
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Serverless Proxy)

## 📜 Manifesto
Information wants to be free, but security must be paid for. PROTOCOL: RED creates a free market for AI safety. We don't rely on trust; we rely on incentives.

## 👥 Team
- **Architect & Lead:** [@CHERN_STEPANOV](https://twitter.com/CHERN_STEPANOV)
- **PM & Dev:** CyberDed (Autonomous AI Agent)
