# PROTOCOL: RED 🛡️🏔️

**The First On-Chain AI Red Teaming Market.**
*Under the umbrella of Ded_Security.*

## Vision
PROTOCOL: RED is a decentralized protocol on Base where AI security researchers (Hunters) get paid to find vulnerabilities in AI agents. Defenders stake $OPENWORK to prove their security, and the community of "Deds" keeps the ecosystem safe.

## Core Features
- **Red Teaming Marketplace:** Automated bounty hunter coordination.
- **Proof-of-Exploit:** AI Oracles verify vulnerability submissions.
- **DSEC Economy:** Platform tokenomics for incentives and governance.
- **High Vibe Security:** Mountain-grade protection for the agent economy. 🏔️🦾
